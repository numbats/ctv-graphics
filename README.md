# ctv-graphics
This is a workspace within which to brainstorm, plan and implement a new CRAN Task View(s) for graphics

# Details on how to create a new CTV

The main information is at https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv, and the link under "Proposal" details steps to get the CTV considered.

# old graphics CTV

In the old-ctv folder of this repo, is the recently removed CTV titled Graphics. You can open it using a text editor. 

The reason for archiving was "Currently, the focus is on the transition of the established task views to the new workflow which also involves the archival of some task views which turned out to be too broad to be maintainable (Graphics and SocialSciences). Also, the gR task view has been renamed to GraphicalModels."

Suggestions for getting started with a new resource were "It's not clear to me what is the best strategy to break this down into more digestable portions with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria and without too much overlap. Some building blocks, say GraphicsDevices or InteractiveGraphics, should work well. But beyond that I haven't got good ideas. If you have any, that would be great."

# Outline of possible steps

1. Collect list of packages related to graphics
2. Organise/decide on topic areas
3. Create draft of CTV page
